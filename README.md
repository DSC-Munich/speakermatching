## What's this project about?
This is our contribution to the DSC Solution Challenge: We are four students from the TU Munich. We founded the DSC Munich last year, with the mission to create a community from students for students where we can learn about exciting topics together. However, it is difficult for community organizers to find speakers for their events. Likewise, after talking to some speakers, they also can't find fitting events for their talks easily. 

Most matches in the community world are found by propagating contacts in person (a speaker can recommend another speaker, for example). This means that we have only access to a small subset of speakers. Our solution is a global platform where speakers and event organizers can register and search for each other, making the match much more efficient and fitting. 

## Technologies used
We used TypeScript for the Frontend for a beautiful UI, and Firebase for the Backend because it is easy to use and provides us with everything we need and more. 

This setup makes our platform scalable for many more communities and speakers worldwide! This goal has been important to us since the beginning because the more people register, the more powerful our tool becomes, and the more exciting events can be held with it!

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run the code:
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
